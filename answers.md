Answer to question 2

What is a Relational Database?
A relational database is a type of database that organizes and stores data in structured formats using tables (also known as relations). Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields), with relationships defined between tables using keys like primary keys and foreign keys. Relational databases are based on Relational Algebra and use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing data.

Key Features of Relational Databases:
Tabular Structure: Data is stored in tables with predefined schemas.
Keys: Use primary keys for unique identification of rows and foreign keys to define relationships between tables.
Data Integrity: Enforces constraints to maintain accuracy and consistency.
Querying: Supports powerful SQL commands for data manipulation and retrieval.
Normalization: Reduces data redundancy and improves data organization.

Examples of Relational Databases

MySQL
Open-source and widely used for web applications.
Popular in the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
Example: Used by WordPress and other content management systems.

PostgreSQL
An open-source relational database known for advanced features like support for JSON and custom functions.
Example: Used by applications requiring complex queries, such as data analytics platforms.

Oracle Database
A commercial relational database with robust performance and scalability features.
Example: Used by large enterprises for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

Microsoft SQL Server
A relational database developed by Microsoft, commonly used in Windows environments.
Example: Frequently used for business applications and data warehouses.

These systems are highly versatile and form the backbone of modern data-driven applications.



Answer to question 3

SQL (Structured Query Language) can be classified into three main categories based on its functionality: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL). Each category serves a specific purpose in managing and interacting with databases.

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
Definition: DDL consists of SQL commands used to define and modify the structure of a database, such as tables, schemas, indexes, and constraints.
Key Characteristics:
Commands affect the schema of the database.
Changes are often permanent and require no rollback mechanism.
Common Commands:
CREATE: Creates a new database object (e.g., table, index).
ALTER: Modifies the structure of an existing object (e.g., add/drop a column).
DROP: Deletes a database object permanently.
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table but retains the table structure.


2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Definition: DML consists of SQL commands used to manipulate the data within database tables. It allows for the retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion of data.
Key Characteristics:
DML commands interact with data, not the schema.
Operations can be rolled back if they are part of a transaction.
Common Commands:
SELECT: Retrieves data from the database.
INSERT: Adds new rows to a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE: Removes specific rows from a table.


3. Data Control Language (DCL)
Definition: DCL consists of SQL commands that control access to the database, defining permissions and roles for users.
Key Characteristics:
DCL ensures data security and authorization.
Typically requires administrator privileges to execute.
Common Commands:
GRANT: Grants specific permissions to a user (e.g., read, write).
REVOKE: Removes permissions previously granted to a user.


Answer to question 4

Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key
A Primary Key and a Foreign Key are both essential concepts in relational database design, and they serve different purposes in ensuring data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.

Primary Key
Definition: A primary key is a column (or a set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each record in that table.

Key Features:

Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column(s) must be unique.
Non-Null: A primary key cannot contain NULL values; it must always have a valid value.
Purpose: Ensures that each record in the table can be uniquely identified.
Single Table: The primary key exists within one table and does not reference another table.


Foreign Key
Definition: A foreign key is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that establishes a link between its values and the primary key values in another table.

Key Features:

Reference: A foreign key references the primary key in another table.
Enforces Relationships: Ensures referential integrity by linking records in related tables.
Allows Nulls/Duplicates: Foreign key columns can contain NULL values and may not be unique unless explicitly restricted.
Parent-Child Relationship: Creates a dependency between the "child" table (foreign key) and the "parent" table (primary key).



Answer to question 5

What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities, attributes, and relationships in a database system. It serves as a blueprint for designing a database, illustrating how data is structured and how different elements interact with each other. ERDs are widely used in database design to ensure clarity and correctness before actual implementation.
